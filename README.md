## Introduction

I would like to develop a website for agriculture management where farmers can efficiently manage their crops and inventory, seek advice from agricultural expert advisors, access real-time weather forecasting, and list their crops for sale. Advisors will have the ability to create and manage their profiles, communicate with farmers, and offer solutions to agricultural challenges. Buyers, including individuals, shopkeepers, and food companies, can purchase crops directly from farmers through the website’s marketplace and engage in communication. Lastly,  the admin will have the authority to oversee all users on the website, manage the marketplace, and generate performance reports for the platform.
